Auto-registered configuration elements

  For framework and libraries writers it can be neat to skip to their user some registration.
  This is why some extension points are supported.

  Assuming your configuration is the following one and that my-extension is a module implementing
  a <<<ResourceTransformer>>> or <<<Filter>>>:

+-----
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <dependencies>
          <dependency>
            <groupId>org.foo.bar</groupId>
            <artifactId>my-extension</artifactId>
            <version>1.0</version>
          </dependency>
        </dependencies>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <phase>package</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>shade</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----

  Then if you register through Java <<<ServiceLoader>> mecanism your <<<ResourceTransformer>>> / <<<Filter>>>
  then Maven Shade Plugin will automatically add them to the configuration even if not references into
  <<<transformers>>> or <<<filters>>>. This way, if your extension does not have any configuration it will
  be active just adding the plugin dependency.
